### üöÄ Initial Release - AnyProxy

A secure tunneling solution with modern architecture, multiple transport protocols, and enhanced security through significant code structure optimizations.

#### ‚ú® Core Features

**Multi-Transport Support**
- **WebSocket**: Firewall-friendly transport with HTTP/HTTPS compatibility
- **gRPC**: High-performance transport with HTTP/2 multiplexing
- **QUIC**: Ultra-low latency transport for mobile and unreliable networks

**Modern Architecture** 
- Group-based routing for multi-environment support
- Port forwarding with direct service access
- Modular transport layer design
- Comprehensive security with per-service access control

**Production-Ready Deployment**
- Docker containers with multi-architecture support
- Clean YAML configuration format
- Optimized Gateway (public) and Client (private) separation
- Automated certificate generation

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

**Configuration Features**
- Pure YAML configuration format for clarity
- Transport selection (websocket/grpc/quic)
- Clean binary naming: `anyproxy-gateway` and `anyproxy-client`

**Configuration Options**
```yaml
transport:
  type: "websocket"  # or "grpc", "quic"

client:
  group_id: "production"  # For group-based routing
  open_ports: []          # For port forwarding
  allowed_hosts: []       # Explicit allow list
  forbidden_hosts: []     # Security blacklist
```

#### üîê Security Enhancements

- **Transport-level TLS**: All protocols use TLS encryption
- **Host-based Access Control**: Allow/deny lists for target services
- **Group Isolation**: Traffic routing based on client groups
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate handling

#### üê≥ Docker Support

- Multi-architecture Docker images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Optimized Alpine-based runtime images
- Health check integration
- Non-root user execution

#### üìä Performance Improvements

- **QUIC Transport**: 0-RTT handshake for faster connections
- **gRPC Transport**: HTTP/2 multiplexing for better throughput
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory footprint

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Build System
- Go 1.23+ requirement
- Cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Docker multi-arch builds
- Clean binary naming: `anyproxy-gateway` and `anyproxy-client`

#### Code Structure
- Modern Go module organization
- Clean package structure under `pkg/`
- Optimized import paths
- Well-structured dependency management
- Comprehensive test coverage

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability Features

- Robust connection management for long-running sessions
- Comprehensive error handling for network failures
- Thread-safe concurrent connection handling
- Enhanced logging system for debugging and monitoring
- Clean import paths and module organization
- Optimized protobuf generation and management

### üìö Documentation
