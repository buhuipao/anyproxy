- Advanced load balancing algorithms

## [v2.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### üöÄ Major Release - AnyProxy v2

AnyProxy v2 is a complete rewrite with modern architecture, multiple transport protocols, and enhanced security.

#### ‚ú® New Features

**Multi-Transport Support**
- **WebSocket**: Firewall-friendly transport with HTTP/HTTPS compatibility
- **gRPC**: High-performance transport with HTTP/2 multiplexing
- **QUIC**: Ultra-low latency transport for mobile and unreliable networks

**Enhanced Architecture** 
- Group-based routing for multi-environment support
- Port forwarding with direct service access
- Modular transport layer design
- Improved security with per-service access control

**Deployment Improvements**
- Docker containers with multi-architecture support
- Simplified configuration with YAML format
- Better separation of Gateway (public) and Client (private) deployments
- Built-in certificate generation

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes

**Breaking Changes from v1**
- Configuration format changed from mixed to pure YAML
- Transport selection required (websocket/grpc/quic)
- Separate binary names: `anyproxy-gateway-v2` and `anyproxy-client-v2`

**New Configuration Options**
```yaml
transport:
  type: "websocket"  # or "grpc", "quic"

client:
  group_id: "production"  # For group-based routing
  open_ports: []          # For port forwarding
  allowed_hosts: []       # Explicit allow list
  forbidden_hosts: []     # Security blacklist
```

#### üîê Security Enhancements

- **Transport-level TLS**: All protocols use TLS encryption
- **Host-based Access Control**: Allow/deny lists for target services
- **Group Isolation**: Traffic routing based on client groups
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate handling

#### üê≥ Docker Support

- Multi-architecture Docker images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Optimized Alpine-based runtime images
- Health check integration
- Non-root user execution

#### üìä Performance Improvements

- **QUIC Transport**: 0-RTT handshake for faster connections
- **gRPC Transport**: HTTP/2 multiplexing for better throughput
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory footprint

### üîß Technical Details

#### Build System
- Go 1.21+ requirement
- Cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Docker multi-arch builds

#### Dependencies
- Updated to latest stable versions
- Removed legacy dependencies
- Added QUIC and gRPC support libraries

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed connection leaks in long-running sessions
- Improved error handling for network failures
- Resolved race conditions in concurrent connections
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

### üìö Documentation

- Completely rewritten README with practical examples
- Architecture diagrams for visual understanding
- Docker deployment guides
- Configuration reference
